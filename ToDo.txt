==WTF we need to do==
Steal Hydra's animation code (STOLEN, now to be implemented ;) )
Look for more stuff Elv broken after last update (as always lol)
Rewrite background hiding during pet battles using Elv's function (I didn't know bout it lol)

==What we maybe can do==
Saw an idea about a dot tracker, saw some coding for it will look at it when have time...
Maybe add the ability to select amount of datatexts on each panel ranging from 1-3 slots
