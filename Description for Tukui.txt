<font color="red"><b>Please Note:</b></font> This addon will not function without ElvUI installed.  You can download it at <a href="http://www.tukui.org/dl.php">http://www.tukui.org</a>.

Shadow & Light is an external edit of ElvUI, meaning it isn't made by changing of ElvUI's files directly.  What this means to you, is that any time ElvUI gets updated, you will not have to worry about it overwriting our edited version of ElvUI.  It also means if we push an update it will not mess with any ElvUI files.  This addon can not be used without ElvUI installed and enabled.

Originally this project started as two personal edits of ElvUI by Darth Predator and I.  For technical support reasons and other reasons as well, we have moved to a combine effort on this external edit of the ElvUI.  Shadow & Light does not disable or hinder the normal function of ElvUI but does add additional features that are not yet implemented or will not be added to ElvUI.
You'll find Shadow & Light options under it's own configuration category in ElvUI's config section by typing /ec
