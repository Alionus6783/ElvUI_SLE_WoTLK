v4.30 8/28/21

- fixed a conflict with a reported weakaura
- fixed enhanced shadows option for unitframes not adjusting the size upon changing the setting in the options until a reload/relog
- aura cooldown threshold now can be enabled/disabled per buff or debuff (if disabled, it will use elvui threshold settings)
- Enhanced Vehicle Bar is now called Dedicated Vehicle Bar and has been rewritten from ground up and now displays the keybind (pulled from elvui bar 1 which is normally used as a vehicle bar) as well as other issues with the old version, any settings before will need to be done for this bar
