v4.29 alpha

- fixed a conflict with a reported weakaura
- fixed enhanced shadows option for unitframes not adjusting the size upon changing the setting in the options until a reload/relog
- aura cooldown threshold now can be enabled/disabled per buff or debuff (if disabled, it will use elvui threshold settings)
